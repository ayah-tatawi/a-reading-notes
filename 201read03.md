There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

<ol>
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element

<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
 minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>

<dl>
The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the <dl> element you will
usually see pairs of <dt> and
<dd> elements.
<dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
<dd>
This is used to contain the
definition.
Sometimes you might see a list
where there are two terms used
for the same definition or two
different definitions for the same
term.
<dl>
<dt>Sashimi</dt>
<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
 condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
 ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
 weight of ingredients</dd>
<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
 from the skin of a fish</dd>
<dt>Scamorze</dt>
<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
 cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
 from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>


The border-width property
is used to control the width
of a border. The value of this
property can either be given
in pixels or using one of the
following values:
thin
medium
thick
(You cannot use percentages
with this property.)
You can control the individual
size of borders using four
separate properties:
border-top-width
border-right-width
border-bottom-width
border-left-width
You can also specify different
widths for the four border values
in one property, like so:

<p class="one">Hohner's "Clavinet" is essentially an
 electric clavichord.</p>
<p class="two">Hohner's "Clavinet" is essentially an
 electric clavichord.</p>
<p class="three">Hohner's "Clavinet" is essentially
 an electric clavichord.</p>

You can control the style of a
border using the border-style
property. This property can take
the following values:
solid a single solid line
dotted a series of square dots
(if your border is 2px wide, then
the dots are 2px squared with a
2px gap between each dot)
dashed a series of short lines
double two solid lines (the
value of the border-width
property creates the sum of the
two lines)
groove appears to be carved
into the page
ridge appears to stick out from
the page
<p class="one">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="two">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="three">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="four">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="five">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="six">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="seven">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>
<p class="eight">Wurlitzer Electric Piano</p>

p.one {border-style: solid;}
p.two {border-style: dotted;}
p.three {border-style: dashed;}
p.four {border-style: double;}
p.five {border-style: groove;}
p.six {border-style: ridge;}
p.seven {border-style: inset;}
p.eight {border-style: outset;}

It is also possible to use a
shorthand to control all four
border colors in the one
property:
border-color: darkcyan
deeppink darkcyan
deeppink;
The values here appear in
clockwise order: top, right,
bottom, left.


---------------------

You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable (using the var
keyword followed by the name of
the array).
The values are assigned to the
array inside a pair of square
brackets, and each value is
separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need
to be the same data type, so you
can store a string, a number and
a Boolean all in the same array.
This technique for creating
an array is known as an array
literal. It is usually the preferred
method for creating an array.
You can also write each value on
a separate line:
colors= ['white',
'black',
'custom'];
On the left, you can see an
array created using a different
technique called an array
constructor. This uses the new
keyword followed by Array();
The values are then specified
in parentheses (not square
brackets), and each value is
separated by a comma. You can
also use a method called i tern()
to retrieve data from the array.
(The index number of the item is
specified in the parentheses.)
var colors
c02/ js/array-constructor.js
new Array('white ' ,
'black',
'custom');
var el = document.getElementByid( ' colors' );
el.innerHTML = colors.item(O); 

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable
color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige. 
LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
The value of buy is now true.

COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
buy = 3 > 5;
The value of buy is fa 1 se.
STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
The value of greeting is now Hi Moll


USING THE DOCUMENT
OBJECT 

var saying
These properties and methods
are often used to work with text
stored in variables or objects.
On the right-hand page, note
how the variable name (saying)
is followed by a dot, then the
property or method that is being
demonstrated (like the name of
an object is followed by a dot
and its properties or methods).
This is why the String object is
known as both a global object,
because it works anywhere
within your script, and a wrapper
object because it acts like a
wrapper around any value that
is a string - you can use this
object's properties and methods
on any value that is a string.
The length property counts
the number of "code units" in a
string. In the majority of cases,
one character uses one code
unit, and most programmers use
it like this. But some of the rarely
used characters take up two
code units.

'Home sweet home •

PROPERTY
length
DESCRIPTION
Returns number of characters in the string
in most cases (see note bottom-left)
METHOD DESCRIPTION
toUpperCase () Changes string to uppercase characters
tolowerCase () Changes string to lowercase characters
charAt ()
i ndexOf()
lastlndexOf()
substring()
split()
trim()
replace()
Takes an index number as a parameter, and returns
the character found at that position
Returns index number of the first time a character or
set of characters is found within the string
Returns index number of the last time a character or
set of characters is found within the string
Returns characters found between two index
numbers where the character for the first index
number is included and the character for the last
index number is not included
When a character is specified, it splits the string
each time it is found, then stores each individual part
ih an array
Removes whitespace from start and end of string
Like find and replace, it takes one value that should
be found, and another to replace it (by default, it only
replaces the first match it finds) 


Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an index
number. Index numbers always start at zero and not one (just like for
items in an array).
