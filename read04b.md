# welcome to read 4 d ^.^
# how do computers work : <P>
*4 common things between all computers
  * inpt
  * storage
  * processing
  * output
**input** is what you tell the computer to do by touch or sound.
**storage** inputs give the computer data to storage in the memory
**processor** it takes information from storage and manipulate them, then send the info back to the storage.
**output** depends on how the computer is designed to do ( image, text,vidio,sound)
### brinary numbers
inside the computer there are wires and circuts carrying all the data.
*using electricty :*
with one wire we can choose between (yes/true/1 when on ,and (no,false,0 when off,
this is called a **bit** and its the smallest piece of info that computers can store.
**binary system**
only 0/1 :
*positions are multiplied by 2*
**numbers**
this system of numbers can also represent texts, images,sounds ... etc, when you represent every letter with a number.
**images**
consist of pixles, each pixle has a color, each color has a number.
### circuts:
every input / output is a type of information, to process it and make an out put computers need to modify signals usig**circuts**
* here are many types of circuts :
 * simple circut : (not) it takes the input and flip it, exp; you enter 1 you get 0.
 * adder circut, to add two bites of information
### cpu,memory :
when you priss on a letter on your keyboard,the keyboard convert it into a number,then CPU calculate how to display the letter pixle by pixle, then store the result as
pixles in memory,finally, the screen convert the binary into colors.
### hardware and software:
*the hardware* is what we see:cpu,speaker..
*the software* what we dont see, but controls the hardware
*cpu* is a mastership controls everything, it has other ships and circuts.
softwares: nowadays we use programming language to communicate with the computer that translates it into pinary languge..
