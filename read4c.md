How do I write a script?
Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages:
HTML
CSS
JavaSrcipt We keep each of them in seperated file, Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose.
HTML (Links to an external site.)
focusing on the most important thing about your site: its content.
HTML+CSS (Links to an external site.)
Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself
HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT (Links to an external site.)
JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.
### Creating JS
Creat a file and open it with any code editor you want
Creat javascript page, with .js extension
each of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT and Images must has it’s own folder.
### Linking JS By write , you can link the code of js with HTML page. You must write this link before the closing tag of body
### How to use Methods and objects We have many of methods for JS ,example:
document.write(‘’) which display the content you wrote at the window of the browser where document is the object .write(‘’) is the method (‘’) is the parameter
Statements (Links to an external site.)
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
If statement if (condition) { statement ;} else if (condition) { statement;} else { statement;} KEEP IN MIND you can write as much as you want of else if statement.
Comment To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes “//” in front of the code or text you wish to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.
Variables It is a container with temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
How to declare them? (Links to an external site.)
var name-of-your-var ;

var name-of-your-var = value; you can write boolen, string or number as variable value
